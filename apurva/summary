Mobile Cloud Computing : A comparison of Application Models

The paper discusses about the two extremes of mobile application that are Native (offline) and Web (online). 
But there is too much of introduced latency for real time responsiveness in Web applications.
Several migration techniques discussed like Augmented execution of applications, application mobility using mechanism like ISR (Internet 
Suspend/Resume)or Java -based platform solutions with heterogeneous hardware solution.
Using cloudlets eliminates the long latency and also increases the responsiveness and interactivity.
The main problem is to enable the Hadoop framework on mobile devices to distribute the processing and storage tasks.
