Dynamic Mobile Cloud Computing: Ad-Hoc and Opportunistic Job Sharing

The paper talks of a model with resource handler, cost handler and job handler as main components. 
The model deploys a master-slave architecture using bluetooth and J2ME. 
To achieve speedup in case of equal job sharing the slave nodes are supposed to be of higher performance than master.
The paper suggests following observations:
1. Offloading gives better performance than sharing.
2. RFCOMM is faster than OBEX for larger messages and for buffer size from 256 to 900 MB. 
3. OBEX has more range. As data length increases the maximum range of transmission 	decreases so does consistency.
The mentioned architecture has advantages like low radiation , low energy cost and wide spread-ability.
The disadvantages is that the system wonâ€™t be able to switch to different protocols like WiFi or 3G.
Also the device capabilities needs to be compared before a job is distributed.
