Performance Evaluation Criteria:
• Average response time per unit time
• Network capacity per second (Mbps)or unit time, the most important factor associated
with this criterion is network bandwidth ,availability and scalability.
• The number of I / O commands per second(IOPS)or unit time
• Average waiting time per unit time
• Workload(requests) to be serviced per second(Mbps) or a unit of time
• Throughput (Req / Sec), this criterion will be recovered recovery, buffering capacity and
processing power factors
• The average time of processing(exe / sec)
• Percentage of CPU utilization 
• The number of requests executed per unit time
• The number of requests per unit time buffer
• The number of rejected requests per unit time
