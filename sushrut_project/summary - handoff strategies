Handoff is the process responsible for continous service in wireless cellular communication systems. It is mechanism that transfers network from one cell to another when there is a change in the coverage area. 
Handoffs occur when power received (by mobile station) from one base station exceeds that of the current base station.
Types of handoffs:
1)Hard handoff: Current base station link disconnects before new is linked.
2)Soft handoff: New network is established before the current network is diconnected.
3)horizontal
4)vertical
A good handover strategy:
-minimum drop-outs
-minimum handovers
-quick switching
